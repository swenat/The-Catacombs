# The Catacombs

This project is a simple TextAdventure game created for a schoolassignment. The game is based on the history of The Catacombs in Paris, therefor the name.

This textadventuregame revolves around the player getting to visit different scenes depending on the options that the player chooses.

The player will get the chance to be given/take items depending on the options chosen, if they are right. There are also a few riddles/issues to solve along the way.

It is short but engaging, hopefully.

The game is built using:

- CSS

- Javascript
